# CLAUDE.md

This is the central project memory and working guide for every assistant in this repository,
including Codex and Claude. The owner explicitly requested this on 2026-09-06.

## Read before working

At the start of every session, read this file first, then all repository-authored documentation:
[README.md](README.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), [future.md](future.md), and
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), plus any documentation added later. Exclude generated files,
dependencies and Git internals. Follow relevant linked instructions before acting.

Keep durable owner decisions, constraints and links to current work here as they change.
Use this file to restore context after a new session or compaction; do not rely on chat history
alone. Read changed documentation again before using it. Current owner instructions take
precedence over older notes. Historical changelog entries describe past behavior.

This file is the central index, while each supporting document keeps its purpose:
- README: repository structure, setup and deployment.
- DESIGN: the single source of truth for visual rules; read before visual edits and keep in sync.
- future: outstanding work, dependencies and unresolved decisions.
- CHANGELOG: the history of implemented changes.
- CaspianOS-App's TODO.md: anything only the owner can do. Not a file in this repository — see
  "Owner items live in CaspianOS-App's TODO.md" below.

## Owner decisions and current state

- Marketing: https://caspianerp.com (this repository).
- Application: https://app.caspianerp.com.
- Administration: https://admin.caspianerp.com.
- Documentation: https://docs.caspianerp.com.
- Connect the sites through relevant navigation. Marketing currently links to all three;
  reciprocal links require the other repositories. Links do not establish shared authentication.
  The admin site's audience and live entry flows still need verification.
- CaspianTools has no physical office yet. Publish no real or invented telephone numbers,
  telephone links, office address, map or invitation to visit. Use email and online demos.
  Existing Bursa legal references are not proof of an office or verified registered address.
- Pricing is undecided. Help the owner develop a pricing model; do not expect them to supply
  arbitrary numbers. No invented prices, plan allocations, discounts or trial commitments.
  Provisional offers have been removed from the source; the pricing page invites enquiries.
- The contact form validates and previews email drafts, with mail-app and webmail-copy actions.
  It does not send or store leads. A backend remains outstanding.
- Product views use labeled sample data; authentic screenshots and evidence remain outstanding.
- Google Analytics 4 is installed, on the owner's instruction of 2026-09-10, with the measurement
  ID `G-14GPENV8PG`. It supersedes the older "no third-party scripts, trackers or cookies" rule,
  which now reads as "GA is the only one". The ID lives in exactly one place,
  `public/assets/js/analytics.js`. The tag is the standard gtag.js pair of commands, moved into a
  file because the CSP allows no inline script; it is deferred so `lang.js` can redirect an
  unprefixed URL before a hit is sent, and the visit is counted on the page actually read.
  The owner declined a consent banner: the tag runs for every visitor, cookies and all. That is a
  live GDPR/ePrivacy exposure for EEA visitors — German, French and Norwegian pages are served —
  and it is recorded as `T27` in CaspianOS-App's `TODO.md`, not re-raised here unprompted.
  Switching to Consent Mode with `analytics_storage: denied` is a few lines in that one file if the
  owner ever wants it.
- Playwright Test is installed as a development dependency. Chromium launch and rendering
  were verified; a full browser suite has not yet been added. See README for setup.
- The site ships in seven languages — en, az, tr, ru, nb, de, fr — matching the application's list.
  English under `public/` is hand-written and is the source; the other six are generated into
  `public/<lang>/` by `scripts/i18n-build.mjs` and committed, because hosting serves the repository
  as-is. Never hand-edit a generated page. The translations were produced in-house, and the owner
  accepted them as shipped on 2026-09-08, declining a native-speaker review for now. The review
  stays in future.md as optional polish, not a pending ask — do not re-raise it unprompted.
- A localized page hands its language to the application: *Sign in* links on `/<lang>/…` point at
  `https://app.caspianerp.com/<lang>/welcome`, not the bare host, because the app reads a
  `/{lang}/` prefix from its own URL and redirects an unprefixed URL to `/en/…`. `APP_ORIGIN` and
  `APP_ENTRY` in `i18n/config.mjs` are the only place those values live; the generator rewrites
  the links. If the app's language list or its entry route changes, this is what must follow.
- Track remaining work in future.md. Verify Git, PR and deployment state before claiming a
  change is committed, merged or live; a local edit or changelog entry is not deployment proof.

## Owner items live in CaspianOS-App's TODO.md

Saying it in the session is not handing it over. Sessions end and chat scrolls, so an item raised
only in a reply is lost, then rediscovered weeks later by a session that has no idea it was already
raised. Anything this repository leaves for the owner goes into **`TODO.md` in CaspianOS-App**
(`https://github.com/CaspianTools/CaspianOS-App`), which is the owner's single queue for all three
repositories — the application, the platform cockpit (CaspianOS-Admin) and this site. Report it in
the session as well; the report is the notification, that file is the record.

There is deliberately **no `TODO.md` in this repository**. One person with one Google Cloud console,
one registrar and one Stripe account should not be asked to remember three lists. Do not start one
here.

**What belongs there.** Only what the owner can do and an assistant cannot: a console or DNS step,
a credential an assistant must never hold, a decision the code cannot make — pricing being the
standing example in this repository — or a check that only works against the live site. If an
assistant can do it, it does it, and it is not written down. Outstanding work that is merely
unstarted stays in `future.md`; it moves to the app's `TODO.md` only once it blocks something
already shipped, or once an assistant is waiting on the answer to continue.

**The cross-repository seam.** A session working here usually cannot commit to CaspianOS-App in the
same commit as the change that raised the item. When that happens, attach that repository
(`add_repo`) and add the entry as soon as it is in reach — the seam is not a reason for the item to
go unrecorded. Follow that file's own conventions rather than inventing a shape: stable `T` ids that
are never renumbered or reused, and each entry carrying *what to do*, *why it matters*, *context*
and *done when*. Read the file before adding, so an item already there is updated, not duplicated.

## What this repo is

The public marketing site for **caspianerp.com** — hand-written static HTML and CSS, no build step,
no runtime dependencies, deployed to Firebase Hosting in the `caspianos` project. The Caspian ERP
application lives in a separate repository and deploys separately to `app.caspianerp.com`.

Caspian ERP (formerly CaspianOS — only the repository names and the `caspianos` Firebase project
keep the old name; `caspianos.io` is no longer ours, so never link or mail to it) is a **CaspianTools**
product from a remote software studio without a physical office. The attribution
lives in the footer's copyright line, the `/about` studio section and the entity named in
`/privacy` and `/terms` — keep those consistent if any of it changes. There is deliberately no
credit paragraph under the footer logo.

## Ship rule — run this on autopilot

**On successful completion of any task, take it all the way to merged. Do not ask for permission
at any step.** "Successful completion" means the work is done and the checks below pass — not that
every idea in the conversation is finished.

1. **Commit** to the session's designated branch, with a message that explains what changed and
   why. Never commit directly to `main`.
2. **Push** with `git push -u origin <branch>`. On a network failure, retry up to four times with
   exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s).
3. **Open a pull request** against `main` describing the change. One PR per task; if a task
   continues on a branch that already has an open PR, push to it rather than opening a second one.
4. **Subscribe to the PR** with `subscribe_pr_activity`, and keep it watched until it is merged or
   closed. Schedule a check-in (`send_later`, roughly hourly) so a missed webhook does not leave
   the PR sitting.
5. **Drive it to green.** Every red check and every review comment is work now:
   - Reproduce the failure, fix the cause, validate locally, push. One validated push beats three
     speculative ones.
   - Never skip, disable or quarantine a check to get green. Never push an empty commit to kick CI.
   - A conflict with `main` is resolved by merging `main` in, not by rewriting history.
6. **Merge when green** — CI passing, no conflict, no unresolved review thread. Then stop watching.

If a step is genuinely blocked — merge permission denied, a required approval that only a human can
give, a failure whose fix is outside the task's scope — say so plainly in the session, leave the PR
open with a comment explaining exactly what is blocking it, and keep it watched. Blocked is the
only reason to stop short of merged; it is never a reason to go quiet.

Merging `main` deploys the site, so the rule above is the deploy pipeline. Treat a red `main` as
the highest-priority thing in the session.

## Before you push

There is no bundler. Run all source and behavioral checks — CI runs exactly
the same commands:

```bash
node scripts/check-html.mjs     # unbalanced or mismatched tags
node scripts/check-links.mjs    # internal links and #anchors that do not resolve
node scripts/check-assets.mjs   # every page links the same ?v= asset version
node --test scripts/check-interactions.mjs # navigation, email composer, language redirect
node scripts/check-i18n.mjs     # translations complete, generated pages up to date
```

They walk `public/` recursively, so pages under `public/modules/` — and every generated
`public/<lang>/` tree — are checked like any other.

**If you edit an English page, regenerate the translations before you push.** The generated trees
are committed, so a page edited without a re-run ships a half-translated site:

```bash
node scripts/i18n-extract.mjs   # refresh i18n/_catalog.json
# translate any new strings into every i18n/<lang>.json
node scripts/i18n-build.mjs     # regenerate public/<lang>/ and sitemap.xml
node scripts/check-i18n.mjs
```

`check-i18n.mjs` regenerates every page in memory and compares it with the committed file, so this
is enforced rather than remembered.

**If you change the site's URLs, update the sitemap.** `public/sitemap.xml` is generated by
`scripts/i18n-build.mjs` — it lists every page in all seven languages, and it is never hand-edited.
Adding, renaming, moving or deleting a page under `public/` (module pages included) changes the URL
set, so re-run the generator and commit what it writes:

```bash
node scripts/i18n-build.mjs     # rewrites public/sitemap.xml from the pages on disk
node scripts/check-i18n.mjs     # fails if the committed sitemap is stale
```

`check-i18n.mjs` compares the generated sitemap with the committed one, so a forgotten re-run is
caught. Two things it cannot catch, because they are constants the generator reads rather than facts
it derives — both at the top of `scripts/i18n-build.mjs`:

- `LASTMOD` — the date stamped on every entry. The checks pass whatever it says, so a content change
  a crawler should come back for is a reason to set it to that day's date.
- `PRIORITY` — per-URL weight, keyed by the English path (`/pricing`, not `/de/pricing`). A new
  top-level page with no entry ships silently at the `0.8` default; add one if that is wrong.

`public/robots.txt` is hand-written and points crawlers at
`https://caspianerp.com/sitemap.xml`, so if `ORIGIN` in `i18n/config.mjs` ever changes, that line
must follow. `/404` is excluded on purpose.

**If you edit `site.css` or `site.js`, bump the version.** Versions are `YYYYMMDD`, with a
`.N` suffix for a second change on the same day (`20260904.2`). Hosting serves `/assets/**` with
`max-age=31536000, immutable`, so a returning visitor keeps the old stylesheet for a year unless
the URL changes. Every page links them as `?v=<date>`; change the file, change the version in
*every* page:

```bash
sed -i 's|site\.css?v=[0-9.]*|site.css?v=NEW|g; s|site\.js?v=[0-9.]*|site.js?v=NEW|g' \
  public/*.html public/modules/*.html
node scripts/check-assets.mjs
```

Shipping new HTML against a cached old stylesheet is what breaks the site for everyone who has
visited before — and it looks fine to anyone testing in a fresh browser, so nothing catches it
except this rule.

To see what production actually serves — clean URLs are a hosting feature, so a plain static
server will 404 on `/modules`:

```bash
npx firebase-tools emulators:start --only hosting
```

## Non-negotiables

- **Claims must be true.** No invented customer logos, testimonials, certifications, metrics or
  features. Every tool described on the site exists in the application.
- **JavaScript is an enhancement.** Every page must render, read and navigate with JS disabled.
  Anything hidden until JS runs (`.reveal`) needs a `<noscript>` override in the page head.
- **Google Analytics is the only third-party script.** The external requests are the Inter
  webfont and the GA4 tag (`G-14GPENV8PG`), loaded by `public/assets/js/analytics.js` — a file,
  not Google's inline snippet, because `script-src` carries no `'unsafe-inline'` and the browser
  would refuse to run it. Adding any other tracker, embed or A/B tool is an owner decision.
  Two things move together with it: the CSP in `firebase.json`, which is what actually permits
  the tag, and `/privacy`, which must keep describing what is set.
- **No template engine.** The header and footer are duplicated in every page on purpose. Change
  the nav or footer in *all* pages, and keep `aria-current="page"` correct. The three
  `<!--i18n:…-->` regions inside them (hreflang alternates, header language menu, drawer language
  row) are the exception: they belong to the generator, so edit `scripts/i18n-build.mjs`, never the
  markup in a page.
- **Every language must work with JavaScript off.** The switcher is a `<details>` of ordinary
  links, and `/tr/pricing` serves Turkish to everyone. `lang.js` only redirects an unprefixed URL,
  never one that names its language — that is what keeps shared links and crawlers intact.
- **Root-relative links, no extension.** `/modules/hr`, never `modules/hr.html`.
- **Escape bare ampersands** in copy (`&amp;`) — several module names contain one.
- **Keep `DESIGN.md` in sync** with `public/assets/css/site.css`. Do not start a competing design
  doc, and do not import patterns from the application's design system.
